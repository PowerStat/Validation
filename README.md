# PowerStat's validation utilities

These validation utilities are used by some of my projects.

## Installation

Because this library is only useful for developers the installation depends on your build environment.

For example when using Apache Maven you could add the following dependency to your project:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.powerstat</groupId>
      <artifactId>validation</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Other build tools like gradle will work analogous.

To compile this project yourself you could use:

    mvn clean install org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage site
    
or simply:

     mvn clean install

## Usage

For usage in your own projects please read the Javadoc's and follow the examples in the unittests.
